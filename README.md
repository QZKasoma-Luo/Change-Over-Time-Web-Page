By running this web pages, you need to install node.js (version 16.xx) and run npm install in the folder change-over-time before you run npm run serve.
After the npm run serve has finshed, you can open the web-page by going to the local host

Notice: This Web-page does not support any version before IE8, and the support of IE has been stoped in June 2022 that this web-page should work on your computer web browser (please do not say that you are using IE mode in edge to browse this..., you have edge already! Use edge!! lol)
